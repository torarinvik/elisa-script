# Vendored Elisa compiler sources

This directory began as a snapshot of the reusable Elisa-language portions of the
self-hosted Elisa compiler. It is the starting point for Elisascript's shared
frontend and native backend and now carries explicitly documented Elisascript
adaptations.

## Source

- Repository: `../Elisa-compiler`
- Commit: `e56d6f2d3612a855066596f13f027926e9dea016`
- Commit date: `2026-08-27T15:25:59+02:00`
- Commit subject: `refactor: drive lexer for loops with machines`
- Source worktree status when copied: clean

## Included

- `src/lexer`: Elisa lexer
- `src/parser`: parser and AST model
- `src/semantic`: name resolution, typing, effects, ownership, contracts, and diagnostics
- `src/backend`: existing LLVM backend and EASM support
- `elisacore_std`: runtime and standard-library sources required by the frontend/backend

All `.elisa` files in these source directories were copied with their relative
layout intact. Existing relative `include` paths therefore continue to work.

## Deliberately excluded

- The existing `elisac` driver: Elisascript will have its own `.elisascript` driver.
- The complete compiler test suite and generated build output: compatibility tests
  needed by Elisascript are copied separately under `test/lexer/elisa_compat` and
  `test/parser/elisa_compat`.

Elisascript-specific additions currently include explicit shebang handling,
call-shaped typed-literal parsing, nominal typed-literal builtins, and compile-time
typed-literal validation. Their rationale and tests are documented under `docs/`.
- Shell/Python build scripts: Elisascript should replace these rather than inherit them.

## Modification policy

Keep general Elisa language fixes suitable for both compilers in the upstream
Elisa compiler and refresh this snapshot deliberately. Elisascript-specific MIR,
bytecode, VM, effect-handler, scripting-library, and driver code belongs outside
`vendor/elisa`.
